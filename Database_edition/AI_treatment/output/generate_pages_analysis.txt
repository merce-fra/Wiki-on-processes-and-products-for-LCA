1-First step: Create product files for each produced product.

name: pd_anode_formed_foil.txt
**Product: pd_anode_formed_foil**

__List of processes__
  * [[process:ps_slitting_of_anode_foil_zhang]]

__May be similar to the following products__

END FILE

name: pd_scraps_of_anode_formed_foil.txt
**Product: pd_scraps_of_anode_formed_foil**

__List of processes__
  * [[process:ps_slitting_of_anode_foil_zhang]]

__May be similar to the following products__

END FILE

2-Second step: Create the process file.
