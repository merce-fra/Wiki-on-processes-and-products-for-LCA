1. First step: Create the product file "pd_gpu.txt"

name: pd_gpu.txt
**Product: pd_gpu**

__List of processes__
  * [[process:ps_nvidia_ai_gpu_chip_parameter_appa]]

__May be similar to the following products__

END FILE

2. Second step: Create the process file "ps_nvidia_ai_gpu_chip_parameter_appa.txt"

name: ps_nvidia_ai_gpu_chip_parameter_appa.txt
**Process: ps_nvidia_ai_gpu_chip_parameter_appa**

__Characteristics__


__Technosphere Flow__

**Production**
  * [[product:pd_gpu]] - Quantity: None unit

**Consumption**
Process:
  * [[process:ps_ai_use_phase]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified
  * [[process:ps_nvidia_gpu_chip_manufacturing]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified

Chimaera (to be classified - put in process by default):

__Biosphere Flow__

END FILE

3. Third step: Create process files for each subprocess:

**Process: ps_ai_use_phase**

__Characteristics__


__Technosphere Flow__

**Production**

**Consumption**
Process:
  * [[process:ps_electricity_no_ei]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified

Chimaera (to be classified - put in process by default):

__Biosphere Flow__

END FILE

name: ps_nvidia_gpu_chip_manufacturing.txt
**Process: ps_nvidia_gpu_chip_manufacturing**

__Characteristics__


__Technosphere Flow__

**Production**

**Consumption**
Process:
  * [[process:ps_nvidia_gpu_die_manufacturing]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified
  * [[process:ps_bga_package_manufacturing]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified

Chimaera (to be classified - put in process by default):

__Biosphere Flow__

__Information__

END FILE

name: ps_nvidia_gpu_die_manufacturing.txt
**Process: ps_nvidia_gpu_die_manufacturing**

__Characteristics__


__Technosphere Flow__

**Production**

**Consumption**
Process:
  * [[process:ps_functional_logic_die_manufacturing]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified

Chimaera (to be classified - put in process by default):

__Technosphere Flow__

**Production**

**Consumption**
Process:
  * [[process:ps_logic_die_manufacturing]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified

Chimaera (to be classified - put in process by default):

**Consumption**
Process:
  * [[process:ps_gold_extraction]] - Quantity: None - Database: Not specified

Chimaera (to be classified - put in process by default):

__Biosphere Flow__

__Information__

END FILE

Note: I did not create files for the terminal processes (electricity_no_ei, logic_die_manufacturing, and gold_extraction) as they appear to be final processes with no further information provided. If more information becomes available about these processes, corresponding files should be created.
